## ARC4CFD

This open-source, asynchronous course on the effective utilization of Advanced Research Computing (ARC) resources for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). This course fills the knowledge gap between a university-level CFD course and the utilization of these CFD tools on modern computing architectures. It's a 16 hour online course that built around concrete examples using open-source CFD tools.

All necessary files can be found in this repository. Access the course [here](https://arc4cfd.github.io).
