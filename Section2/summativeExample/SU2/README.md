SU2 cases are stored in folders Coarse, Intermediate and Fine, according to mesh refinement.

Each folder contains mesh generation file (.geo), SU2 configuration (.cfg) file, batch job script file (su2job_StdEnv.sh & su2job_NiaEnv.sh), gnuplot file (plot_residuals.gp) and sample video in .mp4 format. 
step_to_follow.sh is an instructional document on how to execute the cases in Compute Canada clusters. This is non-executable file, it is intended for copying the built-in commands into working terminal nodes. 
The video BFS_reattachment.mp4 corresponds to a visual representation of Figure 3 in : Le, H., Moin, P., & Kim, J. (1997). Direct numerical simulation of turbulent flow over a backward-facing step. Journal of fluid mechanics, 330, 349-374.

Results for scaling analysis, performed using coarse mesh in NiaEnv SU2 v8, is stored in Scaling folder.
